# Process Time In Assembly Line

You are given the task to calculate how long it
takes to process a list of items in an assembly line, where each item can have a
different time to process and the number of workstations that process these items
is variable. The amount of time it takes to process an item is a positive number,
greater than zero. The number of workstations is greater or equal to zero.

## Example I/O

```javascript
processTime([1, 3, 5, 10], 2); // 13
processTime([2, 7, 15, 2]); // 26
processTime([1,2,3,4,5], 50); // 5
```

## Solution

```javascript
function processTime(items, workstations) {
  // Your code here
}
```
